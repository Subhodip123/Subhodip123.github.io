2018-03-29,Driving a Charged Coupled Device (CCD) by microcontroller for LIBS based application,International Symposium on Devices Circuits and Systems (ISDCS) 2018,CCD is one of the important components in digital imaging. In this paper we analyzed the Charged Coupled Device (CCD) which is going to be used in a LASER INDUCED BREAKDOWN SPECTROGRAPHY (LIBS). Here this LIBS instrument is used for getting the knowledge of the soil mineral composition in agricultural purposes. We provide a total android device controlled platform to drive the total system. Now the main impediment in LIBS is that CCD is driven by FPGA. If we want to optimize the cost we must avoid the FPGA. So we drove the CCD is by ARM Microcontroller that is used in ARDUINO due Board., , ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8379684
2023-09-26,Adapt then Unlearn: Exploiting Parameter Space Semantics for Unlearning in Generative Adversarial Networks,arXiv,The objective of this work is to prevent the generation of outputs containing undesired features from a pre-trained GAN where the underlying training data set is inaccessible. Our approach is inspired by a crucial observation: the parameter space of GANs exhibits meaningful directions that can be leveraged to suppress specific undesired features. However such directions usually result in the degradation of the quality of generated samples. Our proposed method known as Adapt-then-Unlearn excels at unlearning such undesirable features while also maintaining the quality of generated samples, , ,https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14054
