excerpt: 'The objective of this work is to prevent the generation of outputs containing undesired features from a pre-trained GAN where the underlying training data set is inaccessible. Our approach is inspired by a crucial observation: the parameter space of GANs exhibits meaningful directions that can be leveraged to suppress specific undesired features. However such directions usually result in the degradation of the quality of generated samples. Our proposed method known as Adapt-then-Unlearn excels at unlearning such undesirable features while also maintaining the quality of generated samples'
