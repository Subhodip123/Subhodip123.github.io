CCD is one of the important components in digital imaging. In this paper we analyzed the Charged Coupled Device (CCD) which is going to be used in a LASER INDUCED BREAKDOWN SPECTROGRAPHY (LIBS). Here this LIBS instrument is used for getting the knowledge of the soil mineral composition in agricultural purposes. We provide a total android device controlled platform to drive the total system. Now the main impediment in LIBS is that CCD is driven by FPGA. If we want to optimize the cost we must avoid the FPGA. So we drove the CCD is by ARM Microcontroller that is used in ARDUINO due Board.
