permalink: /publications/paper1
excerpt: 'Abstract: CCD is one of the important components in digital imaging. In this paper we analyzed the Charged Coupled Device (CCD) which is going to be used in a LASER INDUCED BREAKDOWN SPECTROGRAPHY (LIBS). Here this LIBS instrument is used for getting the knowledge of the soil mineral composition in agricultural purposes. We provide a total android device controlled platform to drive the total system. Now the main impediment in LIBS is that CCD is driven by FPGA. If we want to optimize the cost we must avoid the FPGA. So we drove the CCD is by ARM Microcontroller that is used in ARDUINO due Board. In this paper for the very first time we present a method to drive TCD1201D CCD image sensor with ARM based microcontroller and also incorporated method of control by android device. Now to drive that CCD we need 6 clock signals (SH, ICG, PHI1, PHI2, RS, BT) that will give the output OS &
DOS. We gave the 2 outputs to a difference amplifier whose output is now fed to the OP484 for amplification. The output of the difference amplifier is then given to one analog channel. From that channel the CCD OUTPUT is analyzed. This CCD OUTPUT is going to an ANDROID device by HC-05 BLUETOOTH module.'
