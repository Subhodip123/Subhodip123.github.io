ðŸš€ I am a third year Ph.D student at Representation Learning Lab of [ECE department, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore](https://ece.iisc.ac.in/), advised by [Dr. Prathosh A.P](https://sites.google.com/view/prathosh/home). I am very fortunate to be mentored by [Dr. Ananda Theertha Suresh](http://theertha.info/) during current years of my Ph.D research.
ðŸš€ Prior to beginning my doctoral studies, I worked as a research associate at [Oneirix Labs](https://www.oneirix.com/) in the field of Medical Imaging and AI.
ðŸš€ I have completed post-graduate studies in Statistics from [Indian Statistical Institute (ISI), Chennai](https://www.isichennai.res.in/) under the supervision of [Prof.Sudheesh Kumar K.](https://www.isichennai.res.in/~skkattu) and undergraduate studies in ECE from [Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology (IIEST),Shibpur](https://www.iiests.ac.in/).

## ðŸ¤” Research Interests

My broader research interest lies in the domain of *privacy and uncertainty aware learning algorithms*.  I am curious to know what each data point contributes in the learning process and I believe that privacy ([Diffential Privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy)) can help understand what these deep networks learn from each datapoint and if needed how we can unlearn ([Machine Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02299)). Also, I am fascinated by distribution free uncertainty estimations for deep neural networks. Below are some of the topics that I am interested in:

- **ðŸ“Œ Privacy:** Machine Unlearning and Differential Privacy.

- **ðŸ“Œ Uncertainty:** Conformal Prediction and Calibration.
<!-- - **AI for Climate Change:** Novel Applications of representation learning for climate change problems. If you are interested to know more click here to join the group: [AI4ClimateChange](https://discord.gg/erxxGtY2) -->
