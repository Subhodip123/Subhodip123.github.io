🚀 I am a third year Ph.D student at Representation Learning Lab of [ECE department, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore](https://ece.iisc.ac.in/), advised by [Dr. Prathosh A.P](https://sites.google.com/view/prathosh/home). I am very fortunate to be mentored by [Dr. Ananda Theertha Suresh](http://theertha.info/) during current years of my Ph.D research. Prior to beginning my doctoral studies, I had the opportunity to spend a brief but enriching period as a Research Associate at [Oneirix Labs](https://www.oneirix.com/), where I was involved in developing algorithms using *applied mathematics* and *computational statistics*, with a particular emphasis on their applications in Medical AI.

🧑‍🎓 I have completed my post-graduate studies in Statistics from [Indian Statistical Institute (ISI), Chennai](https://www.isichennai.res.in/) under the supervision of [Prof.Sudheesh Kumar K.](https://www.isichennai.res.in/~skkattu) and undergraduate studies in ECE from [Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology (IIEST),Shibpur](https://www.iiests.ac.in/).

## 🔍 Research Interests

🧠 My broader research focus lies in designing **privacy- and uncertainty-aware learning algorithms**. I am particularly curious about understanding the contribution of individual data points in the learning process and developing techniques to *remove* or "unlearn" the effect of specific data. Additionally, I am interested in **distribution-free uncertainty estimation** for deep learning.

💡 I believe **[Differential Privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy)** offers a powerful theoretical lens into this question, and **[Machine Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02299)** provides practical tools to achieve it.

### 📚 Topics of Interest

- 🔐 **Privacy**: Machine Unlearning, Differential Privacy  
- 🎲 **Uncertainty**: Conformal Prediction, Calibration  
- 📘 **Others**: Statistics, Learning Theory, Information Theory

<!-- ## 🤔 Research Interests

My broader research interest lies in the domain of ***privacy and uncertainty aware learning algorithms***.  I am curious to know what each data point contributes in the learning process and I believe that privacy ([Diffential Privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy)) can help understand what these deep networks learn from each datapoint and if needed how we can unlearn ([Machine Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02299)). Also, I am fascinated by distribution free uncertainty estimations for deep neural networks. Below are some of the topics that I am interested in:

- **📌 Privacy:** Machine Unlearning and Differential Privacy.
- **📌 Uncertainty:** Conformal Prediction and Calibration.
- **📌 Others:** Statistical Learning Theory and Information Theory. -->
