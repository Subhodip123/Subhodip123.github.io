Hi! I am Subhodip, a second year Ph.D student at Representation Learning Lab of [ECE department, IISc Bangalore](https://ece.iisc.ac.in/) advised by [Prof. Prathosh A.P.](https://sites.google.com/view/prathosh/home). Before starting my doctoral studies, I was working in the domain of Medical Imaging and AI in [Oneirix Labs](https://www.oneirix.com/), a Pune based start-up. I have completed my masters in Statistics from [ISI,Chennai](https://www.isichennai.res.in/) under the supervision of [Prof.Sudheesh Kumar Kattumannil](https://www.isichennai.res.in/~skkattu) and undergraduate studies in ECE from [IIEST,Shibpur](https://www.iiests.ac.in/).

**Research Interests:** My broader research interest lies in the domain of Privacy and Uncertainty aware learning algorithms. I am curious to know what each data point contributes in the learning process and I beleive that privacy ([Diffential Privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy)) can help understand what these deep networks learn from each datapoint and if needed how we can unlearn ([Machine Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02299)). Also, I am pretty fascinated by distribution free uncertainty estimations for deep neural networks. Below are some of the topics that I am interested in:

- **Privacy:** Machine Unlearning, Differential Privacy, Privacy Attacks.
I am creating a community on Machine Unleanrning as this is a fairly new area. Please join the group: [Machine-Unleanrning](https://discord.gg/YU9T5pvF) if interested.
- **Uncertainty:** Conformal Prediction and Calibration.
