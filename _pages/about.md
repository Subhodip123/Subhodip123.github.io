🧑‍🎓 I am a fourth year Ph.D student at Representation Learning Lab of [ECE department, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore](https://ece.iisc.ac.in/), advised by [Prof. Prathosh A.P](https://sites.google.com/view/prathosh/home). I am very fortunate to be mentored by some brilliant researchers ([Dr. Ananda Theertha Suresh](http://theertha.info/), [Prof. Sai Praneeth](https://spkreddy.org/), [Prof. Shubhada Agrawal](https://sites.google.com/view/shubhada-agrawal/home), [Prof. Debabrota Basu](https://debabrota-basu.github.io/)) during current years of my Ph.D research. Before commencing my Ph.D, I have completed my post-graduate studies in Statistics from [Indian Statistical Institute (ISI), Chennai](https://www.isichennai.res.in/) under the supervision of [Prof.Sudheesh Kumar K.](https://www.isichennai.res.in/~skkattu) and undergraduate studies in ECE from [Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology (IIEST),Shibpur](https://www.iiests.ac.in/).

🧑‍💼 I have gained experience through multiple full-time and internship roles in industry as well. I was a Ph.D research intern  at [Adobe Research, Bangalore](https://research.adobe.com/careers/bangalore/) working on data attribution for vision language models. Before this, I had the opportunity to spend a brief but enriching period as a Research Associate at [Oneirix Labs](https://www.oneirix.com/), where I was involved in developing algorithms using *applied mathematics* and *computational statistics*, with a particular emphasis on their applications in Medical AI. During my undergrad, I also worked as a research intern at *Laboratory for Electro-Optics Systems (LEOS)* of [Indian Space Research Organization](https://www.isro.gov.in/LEOS.html).

🏢 I will be completing my Ph.D degree this year and currently seeking full-time research positions. Here is my [CV](/files/CV_subhodip_updated.pdf). Feel free to reachout if you have any relevant open positions!  

## 🔍 Research Interests

🧠 My broader research focus lies in designing **privacy- and uncertainty-aware learning algorithms**. I am particularly curious about understanding the contribution of individual data points in the learning process and developing techniques to *remove* or "unlearn" the effect of specific data.

💡 I believe **[Differential Privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy)** offers a powerful theoretical lens into this question, and **[Machine Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02299)** provides practical tools to achieve it. Additionally, I am interested in **distribution-free uncertainty estimation (e.g. conformal prediction)** for statistical/deep learning.

### 📚 Topics of Interest

- 🔐 **Privacy**: Machine Unlearning, Differential Privacy  
- 🎲 **Uncertainty**: Conformal Prediction, Calibration  
- 📘 **Others**: Statistics, Learning Theory, Information Theory
