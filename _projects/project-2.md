title: "Unlearning GANs via Few shot domain adaptation"
excerpt: "Due to data bias and undesired data present in the dataset, generative models output unintended output which are harmful. To tackle this problem, we unlearn the generative models with the help of the user feedback. In our work using the feedback from the user we try to adapt our GAN so that it only produces the unintened images(negetive images). From there we try to purturb out initial model in such a way that it remain far from adapted model in parameter space."
